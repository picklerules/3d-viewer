# 3D File Viewer

This project is a 3D file viewer built with **Laravel**, **Vite**, and **React**, using **Three.js** for rendering 3D models. It supports multiple 3D file formats, including GLTF, OBJ, FBX, STL, PLY, and VRML, allowing users to load, view, and interact with 3D models directly in the browser.

This project was completed as part of my internship at GeniusXR.

## Features

- **Supports multiple 3D file formats**: GLTF, OBJ, FBX, STL, PLY, and VRML.
- **Dynamic 3D viewer**: Users can interact with the 3D models (zoom, rotate, pan).
- **Material and texture handling**: Automatically applies material colors and textures where applicable.
- **Mesh property calculations**: Calculates and displays mesh details like surface area, volume, number of vertices, and triangles.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: Backend framework for handling the server-side logic.
- **Vite**: Build tool for modern front-end development.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Three.js**: JavaScript library for creating and displaying animated 3D graphics in the browser.
